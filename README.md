# DIG-4715-Project-3-Team-38
This is our final project for DIG 4715 
Controls
WASD to move
Space to jump
Mouse to look

All assets that are currently complete are present in the scene. There is only collision on the floor of the tree house so stay in the tree house to avoid falling. There are no mechanics currently implemented apart from movement, but there will be a mechanic where the player can shoot acorns with different effects on trees and the ground.

ISSUES
-Models have no collision
-There is no way to get back from falling off the level
-Character model can get caught on its side on a ledge, causing it to build downward acceleration while stationary
